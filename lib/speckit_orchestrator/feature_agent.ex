defmodule SpeckitOrchestrator.FeatureAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  A Jido agent owning one feature's run.

  It is a passive state holder: the `FeatureRunner` drives it synchronously via
  `Jido.AgentServer.call/3`, one signal per phase. State fields:

    * `feature` / `worktree` / `ledger` — seeded by `feature.init`.
    * `layout` — the run's resolved `%Layout{}` (FR-011, 012), seeded by
      `feature.init`; threaded into `PhaseRequest.build/3` for the
      worktree-relative breakdown ref.
    * `phase` — the phase last run.
    * `resume_phase` — the phase the run started at (fixed at init, unlike
      `phase` which advances); `resume_prompt` — an optional operator note
      carried alongside it. Both are a stable anchor for future prompt
      injection (state only — no phase request is altered by this feature).
    * `session_id` — Claude session id, carried forward for resume.
    * `status` — `:pending → :running →` terminal (`:done | :escalated |
      :halted | :failed`), set by `feature.finalize`.
    * `last_outcome` / `last_signals` / `last_result` — the most recent phase
      run, consumed by the runner to compute `Pipeline.next/3`.
    * `history` — reverse-chronological per-phase entries.
    * `cost_total` — accumulated recorded spend for this feature.
