defmodule SpeckitOrchestrator.Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Pure phase transition table for a single feature.

  Ordered phases:

      specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement → converge → done

  `next/3` is the whole decision surface — it advances a feature one phase, or
  diverts it to a terminal outcome via one of these gates:

  * **clarify gate** — the Opus reviewer wrote `## NEEDS HUMAN` into the spec.
    `signals.needs_human? == true` at the `:clarify` phase → `:escalated`.
  * **analyze gate** — the deterministic analyze pass found a Critical finding.
    `signals.critical? == true` at the `:analyze` phase → `:halted`; a High
    finding (`signals.high? == true`) → `:escalated`.
  * **artifact gate** — a phase returned a successful transcript but wrote none
    of the files it exists to produce. `signals.missing_artifact` at `:plan`,
    `:tasks`, or `:implement` → `:failed`.
  * **converge gate** — converge itself reported the branch is not ready for
    human review. `signals.not_ready? == true` at `:converge` → `:failed`.

  The artifact and converge gates close a **false-green** class found in a live
  run: a phase can refuse, ask an unanswerable question, or no-op because an
  earlier artifact is missing, and still return a perfectly successful
  transcript. Every downstream phase then reports the problem in prose while the
  pipeline marches to `:done` and opens a PR for an unbuilt feature. Only a
  deterministic "did the file actually appear?" check catches this regardless of
  *why* the phase produced nothing.

  Gate signals are extracted upstream (in `RunPhase`) from the phase output and
  passed in; this module stays pure and side-effect free.
